# OLX Crawler

OLX Crawler is an app written in Go to observe olx.pl ads. Do you want to buy something new for you, your family or friends? Then this app fits your needs. You don't need to check every ad on your own. Our app will do this for you!

## Motivation

It's my friend's idea. I don't care about websites like allegro or olx.pl, but I wanted to help him, so I made this tinny application.
